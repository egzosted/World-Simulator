Player's mission is to survive as long as it's possible. His character is H (human). Arrow keys are responsible for changing position (only between 1 field). In game are also placed special champions that sometimes facilitate gameplay, in other case they are our enemies. If there is fight between two animals / human, stronger wins (bigger power value)
