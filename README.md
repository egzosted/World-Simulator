# World-Simulator
Terminal based OOP app written in C++

Player's mission is to survive as long as it's possible. His character is H (human). Arrow keys are responsible for changing position (only between 1 field). In game are also placed special champions that sometimes facilitate gameplay, in other case they are our enemies. If there is fight between two animals / human, stronger wins (bigger power value)

Power values:

Sheep - 4
Turtle - 2
Wolf - 9

Plants: 0
Two exceptions: KillerSosnowskyi - 10 (also hurts with poison so you die anyway on every meeting)
WolfBerries - poisoning

Animals:
Antelope: 4
Fox: 3
Turtle: 2
